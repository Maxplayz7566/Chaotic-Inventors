# Just a fun little Pictionary sort of game in python.

### Running on windows,

Install all necessary package, and run start.bat.

### Running on Unix `Mac/Linux`,

I would recommend using a gtk supported install of python3.

Install all necessary packages, and run `./start.sh` if you get a permission error run `chmod +777 start.sh`.

Though if you want scorecards to work please use windows. (Correct me if I'm wrong)

# Required packages:
```
pillow
pywebview
flask
flask-socketio
html2image
```
